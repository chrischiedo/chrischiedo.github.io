[Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) is a Kubernetes-native Java framework for building modern cloud-native applications. It is tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, and crafted from best-of-breed Java libraries and standards. It was developed by Red Hat and released as an open-source project in 2019.

Since its release, the project has experienced steady growth and now has over 13K GitHub stars and recently celebrated a significant milestone of reaching over [1,000 community contributors](https://quarkaus.io/1000contributors/) --- Yours truly is proud to be among the 1,000 contributors who were recognized by the Quarkus team.

The main features of Quarkus are:

- **Container-first**: Quarkus applications are optimised for low memory usage and fast startup times. This means that Quarkus is well suited for building cloud-native applications.
- **Reactive core**: Quarkus is based on a [reactive core](https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/quarkus-reactive-architecture), which means that every Quarkus application is a reactive application. This makes Quarkus an excellent choice for building modern applications, from event-driven to function-as-a-service/serverless applications.
- **Standards-based**: The Quarkus programming model builds on top of official standards; for example, [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/) and [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/).
- **Kubernetes-native**: Quarkus makes it easy to deploy microservice applications to Kubernetes without having to understand the intricacies of the underlying Kubernetes framework.
- **Developer joy**: Quarkus makes it trivial to develop simple applications, and easy to develop the more complex ones. It accomplishes this through features like live code reloading (while in dev mode), CLI tooling, Continuous Testing, and [Dev Services](https://quarkus.io/guides/dev-services). 

In this tutorial, we're going to build a simple employee API. The API will support all the standard CRUD (Create, Read, UUpdate, and Delete) operations, exposed via a REST API. The API will use a relational database (PostgreSQL) for data persistence.

All source code for this tutorial is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/chrischiedo/quarkus-employee-rest-api).

> Note: This tutorial uses Quarkus `3.15.1` and Java `21`.

## Create a new Quarkus project

There are three different ways of creating a new Quarkus project:

- Using the Quarkus CLI tool
- Using a build tool (Maven or Gradle)
- Using the Quarkus project starter at [code.quarkus.io](https://code.quarkus.io/).

In this tutorial, we are going to use the first method (Quarkus CLI).

> Visit this [page](https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling) to install the Quarkus CLI tool for your platform.

After installing the CLI tool, you can confirm that everything is working by running this command on your terminal:

```bash
$ quarkus --version
3.15.1
```

The command should print the installed version of the CLI tool (in this case `3.15.1`).

With that out of the way, we are now ready to start building our API.

Run the following command on your terminal to create the employee REST API project:

```bash
$ quarkus create app dev.chiedo.employee:employee-rest-api \
--extension='rest,jdbc-postgresql,hibernate-orm-panache,hibernate-validator,flyway,rest-jackson,smallrye-openapi,config-yaml'
```

> Note: Feel free to replace `dev.chiedo` with your own domain string.

The command above will create a new directory named `employee-rest-api` with the project's starter code:

```bash
$ cd employee-rest-api
$ tree .
.

 						├── GreetingResourceIT.java
 						└── GreetingResourceTest.java

13 directories, 15 files
```

> Note: You can add the `--no-code` option to the previous command to exclude the starter code.

### Application dependencies

In Quarkus, dependencies are usually called `extensions`. When we ran the previous command to create our application, we also used the `--extension` flag to add the required project dependencies:

| Extension           | Purpose                                      |                  
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| quarkus-rest        | A Jakarta REST implementation for building RESTful web services. Uses [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/) as its reactive core              |
| quarkus-jdbc-postgresql     | Connect to PostgreSQL database via JDBC                                              |
| quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache         | Data persistence and ORM capabilities                                                             |
| quarkus-hibernate-validator   | Validate object properties and method parameters for your beans |
| quarkus-flyway     | Handle database schema migrations                                         |
| quarkus-rest-jackson     | Jackson serialization support for Quarkus REST                                                      |
| quarkus-smallrye-openapi   | Document REST APIs with OpenAPI - comes with Swagger UI                     |
| quarkus-config-yaml | Use YAML to configure Quarkus application (instead of the default `properties` file)    


> Note: You can also add individual extensions by using the following command:
```bash
$ quarkus extension add <name of extension>
```
For example:
```bash
$ quarkus extension add rest-jackson
```
The command above will automatically add the dependency to the `pom.xml` file.

#### A small refactoring exercise:

Before we continue, let's make a few changes to the starter project:

- In the `src/main/java/dev/chiedo/employee/` directory, apply the following changes:

	- delete the `GreetingConfig.java` file. We don't need it for the application we are going to build
	- rename the `GreetingResource.java` file to `EmployeeResource.java`
	- rename the `MyEntity.java` file to `EmployeeEntity.java`

- In the `src/main/resources/` directory, apply the following changes:

	- delete the `import.sql` file. We'll be using `Flyway` for database schema migrations

- In the `src/test/java/dev/chiedo/employee/` directory, apply the following changes:

	- rename the `GreetingResourceTest.java` file to `EmployeeResourceTest.java`
	- rename the `GreetingResourceIT.java` file to `EmployeeResourceIT.java`

> Note: You can use your IDE to perform safe refactoring.

### Application architecture

For our application, we are going to use the [Repository pattern](https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm-panache#solution-2-using-the-repository-pattern), with a layered architecture as shown below: 

![Application Architecture](/assets/img/quarkus-api-tutorial/app-architecture.png "Application Architecture")

As we are building a relatively simple application, all the architectural layers will live in the same domain package. In a typical layered architecture, we would create a subpackage to represent each of the different layers (presentation, business, persistence, etc).

## Database: Create database schema migrations using Flyway

Flyway is a tool that helps with database versioning and schema migrations. Create the first Flyway migration file in the following location: `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__employee_table_create.sql`. The file contains the schema for the `employee` database table.

File: `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__employee_table_create.sql`
{:.muted}

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
    employee_id     BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name      VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    middle_name     VARCHAR(50),
    last_name       VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    department      VARCHAR(50),
    email_address   VARCHAR(50),
    phone_number    VARCHAR(50)
);
```

Here's the second migration file that will populate the `employee` table with some initial data:

File: `src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__employee_table_data.sql`
{:.muted}

```sql
INSERT INTO employee (
    first_name,
    middle_name,
    last_name,
    department,
    email_address,
    phone_number) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Brown', 'Engineering', 'john@example.com', '+1-722504507');

INSERT INTO employee (
    first_name,
    middle_name,
    last_name,
    department,
    email_address,
    phone_number) VALUES ('Ashley', 'William', 'Weber', 'Finance', 'ash@example.com', '+254-728504502');
```

## Persistence layer: Data persistence using Hibernate ORM with Panache

### Create the `EmployeeEntity` class

An Entity class represents a table stored in the database. Every instance of an Entity class represents a row in a database table. Entity objects are tightly coupled to the underlying database structure. The mapping/conversion between entity objects and database tables is done using an ORM tool, like [Hibernate ORM](https://hibernate.org/orm/).

Here's the `EmployeeEntity` class:

File: `src/main/java/dev/chiedo/employee/EmployeeEntity.java`
{:.muted}

```java
// import statements omitted. Check project repo for full code

@Entity(name = "Employee")
@Table(name = "employee")
public class EmployeeEntity {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "employee_id")
    private long employeeId;

    @NotEmpty
    @Column(name = "first_name")
    private String firstName;

    @Column(name = "middle_name")
    private String middleName;

    @NotEmpty
    @Column(name = "last_name")
    private String lastName;

    @Column(name = "department")
    private String department;

    @Email
    @Column(name = "email_address")
    private String emailAddress;

    @Column(name = "phone_number")
    private String phoneNumber;

    // getters, setters, equals, hashCode, toString methods elided...

}
```

> Note: You can use a library like [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) to reduce the amount of boilerplate code that you need to write.

### Create the `EmployeeRepository` class

File: `src/main/java/dev/chiedo/employee/EmployeeRepository.java`
{:.muted}

```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class EmployeeRepository implements PanacheRepositoryBase<EmployeeEntity, Long> {
}
```

By implementing the `PanacheRepositoryBase` interface, the `EmployeeRepository` class has access to many of the convenient methods defined in the `PanacheRepositoryBase` interface.

## Domain: Create the `Employee` domain model object

The `Employee` class represents the domain model object.

File: `src/main/java/dev/chiedo/employee/Employee.java`
{:.muted}

```java
// import statements omitted. Check project repo for full code

public class Employee {

    private long employeeId;

    @NotEmpty
    private String firstName;

    private String middleName;

    @NotEmpty
    private String lastName;

    private String department;

    @Email
    private String emailAddress;

    private String phoneNumber;

    // getters, setters, equals, hashCode, toString methods elided...

}
```

## Entity-to-domain object mapping

We need to create mappings between the `domain` object and the `entity` object. For this purpose, we will use [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/).

Add the MapStruct dependency and the corresponding compiler plugin configuration to the `pom.xml` file:

File: `pom.xml`
{:.muted}

```xml
<properties>
    ...
    <org.mapstruct.version>1.6.0</org.mapstruct.version>
</properties>

...

<dependencies>
	...
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>org.mapstruct</groupId>
	    <artifactId>mapstruct</artifactId>
	    <version>1.6.0</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>

<build>
	</plugins>
		...
		<plugin>
			<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
		    <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
		    <version>3.8.1</version>
		    <configuration>
		        <annotationProcessorPaths>
		            <path>
		                <groupId>org.mapstruct</groupId>
		                <artifactId>mapstruct-processor</artifactId>
		                <version>${org.mapstruct.version}</version>
		            </path>
		        </annotationProcessorPaths>
		    </configuration>
		</plugin>
	</plugins>
</build>
```

Here's the mapper itself that provides a one-to-one mapping between the domain and entity objects:

File: `src/main/java/dev/chiedo/employee/EmployeeMapper.java`
{:.muted}

```java
package dev.chiedo.employee;

import org.mapstruct.Mapper;

@Mapper(componentModel = "cdi")
public interface EmployeeMapper {

    EmployeeEntity toEntity(Employee domain);

    Employee toDomain(EmployeeEntity entity);
}
```

> Note: The mapper is annotated with `@Mapper(componentModel = "cdi")`. This allows the mapper to get injected wherever its needed.

## Business layer: Create the `EmployeeService` class

The `Service` class handles the business logic of our application. In the case of an API, this means handling of CRUD operations. The Service class accepts and returns 
`Domain` objects.

Here's the `EmployeeService` class:

File: `src/main/java/dev/chiedo/employee/EmployeeService.java`
{:.muted}

```java
// import statements omitted. Check project repo for full code

@ApplicationScoped
public class EmployeeService {

    private final EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;
    private final EmployeeMapper employeeMapper;

    // constructor injection
    public EmployeeService(EmployeeRepository employeeRepository, EmployeeMapper employeeMapper) {
        this.employeeRepository = employeeRepository;
        this.employeeMapper = employeeMapper;
    }

    public List<Employee> findAll() {
        return employeeRepository.findAll().stream()
                .map(employeeMapper::toDomain)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    public Optional<Employee> findById(long employeeId) {
        return employeeRepository.findByIdOptional(employeeId).map(employeeMapper::toDomain);
    }

    @Transactional
    public void save(Employee employee) {
        EmployeeEntity employeeEntity = employeeMapper.toEntity(employee);
        employeeRepository.persist(employeeEntity);
    }

    @Transactional
    public void update(long employeeId, Employee employee) {
        Optional<EmployeeEntity> optionalEmployeeEntity = employeeRepository.findByIdOptional(employeeId);

        if (optionalEmployeeEntity.isEmpty()) {
            throw new NotFoundException(String.format("No Employee found with employeeId[%s]", employee.getEmployeeId()));
        }

        EmployeeEntity employeeEntity = optionalEmployeeEntity.get();

        employeeEntity.setEmployeeId(employeeId);
        employeeEntity.setFirstName(employee.getFirstName());
        employeeEntity.setMiddleName(employee.getMiddleName());
        employeeEntity.setLastName(employee.getLastName());
        employeeEntity.setDepartment(employee.getDepartment());
        employeeEntity.setEmailAddress(employee.getEmailAddress());
        employeeEntity.setPhoneNumber(employee.getPhoneNumber());

        employeeRepository.persist(employeeEntity);
    }

    @Transactional
    public void delete(Employee employee) {
        EmployeeEntity employeeEntity = employeeMapper.toEntity(employee);

        employeeRepository.delete(employeeEntity);
    }
}
```

Notice the `@Transactional` annotation for the `save`, `update`, and `delete` methods. This annotation is required as these actions are actually _modifying_ the underlying database.

## Presentation layer: Create the `EmployeeResource` class

The `Resource` layer mainly manages REST concerns (accepting HTTP requests and returning responses).

The `Resource` class is similar to the `Controller` class in Spring Boot.

Here's the `EmployeeResource` class:

File: `src/main/java/dev/chiedo/employee/EmployeeResource.java`
{:.muted}

```java
// import statements omitted. Check project repo for full code

@Path("/api/v1/employees")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class EmployeeResource {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(EmployeeResource.class);

    private final EmployeeService employeeService;

    // constructor injection
    public EmployeeResource(EmployeeService employeeService) {
        this.employeeService = employeeService;
    }

    @GET
    @Operation(summary = "Returns all existing employees")
    @APIResponses(
            value = {
                    @APIResponse(
                            responseCode = "200",
                            description = "Get All Employees",
                            content = @Content(mediaType = "application/json",
                                    schema = @Schema(type = SchemaType.ARRAY, implementation = Employee.class))),
                    @APIResponse(
                            responseCode = "404",
                            description = "No employees found",
                            content = @Content(mediaType = "application/json"))
            }
    )
    public Response getAllEmployees() {
        return Response.ok(employeeService.findAll()).build();
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/{employeeId}")
    @Operation(summary = "Returns an employee given the employee Id")
    @APIResponses(
            value = {
                    @APIResponse(
                            responseCode = "200",
                            description = "Get Employee by employeeId",
                            content = @Content(mediaType = "application/json",
                                    schema = @Schema(type = SchemaType.OBJECT, implementation = Employee.class))),
                    @APIResponse(
                            responseCode = "404",
                            description = "No Employee found for the employeeId provided",
                            content = @Content(mediaType = "application/json"))
            }
    )
    public Response getEmployeeById(@PathParam("employeeId") Long employeeId) {
        Optional<Employee> optionalEmployee = employeeService.findById(employeeId);

        if (optionalEmployee.isPresent()) {
            LOGGER.info("Found employee {}", optionalEmployee);
            return Response.ok(optionalEmployee.get()).build();
        } else {
            LOGGER.debug("No employee found with id {}", employeeId);
            return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build();
        }
    }

    @POST
    @Operation(summary = "Adds a new employee")
    @APIResponses(
            value = {
                    @APIResponse(
                            responseCode = "201",
                            description = "Employee created successfully",
                            content = @Content(mediaType = "application/json",
                                    schema = @Schema(type = SchemaType.OBJECT, implementation = Employee.class))),
                    @APIResponse(
                            responseCode = "400",
                            description = "Employee already exists with employeeId",
                            content = @Content(mediaType = "application/json")),
            }
    )
    public Response createEmployee(@RequestBody(required = true) @Valid Employee employee) {
        employeeService.save(employee);
        URI employeeUrl = URI.create("/api/v1/employees/" + employee.getEmployeeId());
        LOGGER.info("New employee added at URL {}", employeeUrl);
        return Response.created(employeeUrl).build();
    }

    // update and delete endpoints are omitted. Check project repo for full code
}
```

## Application configuration properties

We specify our application's configuration properties in the `application.yml` file:

File: `src/main/resources/application.yml`
{:.muted}

```yaml
quarkus:
  banner:
    enabled: false
  datasource:
    db-kind: postgresql
    devservices:
      image-name: postgres:16
  hibernate-orm:
    database:
      generation: none

"%dev":
  quarkus:
    log:
      level: INFO
      category:
        "dev.chiedo":
          level: DEBUG
    hibernate-orm:
      log:
        sql: true
    flyway:
      migrate-at-start: true
      locations: db/migration,db/testdata

mp:
  openapi:
    extensions:
      smallrye:
        info:
          title: Employee API
          version: 0.0.1
          description: REST API for employees data
```

Instead of running a database instance locally, Quarkus provides a set of tools known as [devservices](https://quarkus.io/guides/dev-services). With Dev Services, the Quarkus app automatically spins up a new [Testcontainer](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/databases/) for the appropriate database based on the inclusion of a specific `quarkus-jdbc` extension in your project (in our case, it's `quarkus-jdbc-postgresql`). This wires up all the infrastructure needed to run a PostgreSQL container in the background.

> Note: `Dev Services` requires a working container runtime (Docker or Podman) to be installed on your machine.

For the `quarkus` property settings, we specify the container image (`postgres:13`) that Dev Services should use when spinning up a database instance for our application. We also set properties specific to the `dev` mode, for example: `log` levels and `flyway` schema migration behaviour.

The last section has OpenAPI/Swagger documentation settings.

## Run the application

At this point we have a fully functional employee REST API application.

From the terminal, run the following command to start the application:

```bash
$ quarkus dev
```

The command above will start the application in `dev` (development) mode.

We can use the `curl` tool (as a REST client) to interact with the API:

```bash
$ curl localhost:8080/api/v1/employees | jq
[
  {
    "employeeId": 1,
    "firstName": "John",
    "middleName": "Doe",
    "lastName": "Brown",
    "department": "Engineering",
    "emailAddress": "john@example.com",
    "phoneNumber": "+1-722504507"
  },
  {
    "employeeId": 2,
    "firstName": "Ashley",
    "middleName": "William",
    "lastName": "Weber",
    "department": "Finance",
    "emailAddress": "ash@example.com",
    "phoneNumber": "+254-728504502"
  }
]
```

> Note that we are piping the output from `curl` through [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to get a well formatted output.

We can get a single employee by running the following command:

```bash
$ curl localhost:8080/api/v1/employees/1 | jq
{
  "employeeId": 1,
  "firstName": "John",
  "middleName": "Doe",
  "lastName": "Brown",
  "department": "Engineering",
  "emailAddress": "john@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "+1-722504507"
}
```

We can add a new employee by running the following command:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"firstName" : "William" , "middleName" : "Davis", "lastName" : "Monroe", "department" : "Training", "emailAddress" : "will@example.com", "phoneNumber" : "+1-77501417"}' localhost:8080/api/v1/employees
```

If we run the command to get all employees again, you'll see that we have the newly added employee:

```bash
$ curl localhost:8080/api/v1/employees | jq
[
  {
    "employeeId": 1,
    "firstName": "John",
    "middleName": "Doe",
    "lastName": "Brown",

  }
]
```

You can test the other endpoints (update and delete) on your own.

> Note: Apart from `curl`, you can use other tools to interact with the API, for example: [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

## Check Swagger API documentation

Visit `localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui` on your browser to see the Swagger documentation for the API:

![Swagger documentation](/assets/img/quarkus-api-tutorial/swagger-api-docs.png "Swagger documentation")

## Write tests

As we are going to use assertions in our tests, we need to add the [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) library to the `pom.xml` file:

File: `pom.xml`
{:.muted}

```xml
...

<dependencies>
	...
	<dependency>
        <groupId>org.assertj</groupId>
        <artifactId>assertj-core</artifactId>
        <version>3.26.3</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
...
```

Here are simple examples of tests that we can write for our API:

File: `src/test/java/dev/chiedo/employee/EmployeeResourceTest.java`
{:.muted}

```java
// import statements omitted. Check project repo for full code

@QuarkusTest
public class EmployeeResourceTest {

    private Employee createNewEmployee() {
        Employee employee = new Employee();

        employee.setFirstName(RandomStringUtils.randomAlphabetic(10));
        employee.setMiddleName(RandomStringUtils.randomAlphabetic(10));
        employee.setLastName(RandomStringUtils.randomAlphabetic(10));
        employee.setDepartment(RandomStringUtils.randomAlphabetic(10));
        employee.setEmailAddress(RandomStringUtils.randomAlphabetic(10) + "@example.com");
        employee.setPhoneNumber(RandomStringUtils.randomNumeric(10));

        return employee;
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetAllEmployeesEndpointReturnsStatusCode200() {
        given()
                .when().get("/api/v1/employees")
                .then()
                .statusCode(200);
    }

    @Test
    public void testCreateEmployeeFailsWithMissingFirstName() {
        Employee employee = createNewEmployee();

        employee.setFirstName(null);

        given()
                .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
                .accept(ContentType.JSON)
                .body(employee)
                .post("/api/v1/employees")
                .then()
                .statusCode(400);
    }
}
```

In order to run our tests, we need to add test configuration settings to the 
`application.yml` file:

File: `src/main/resources/application.yml`
{:.muted}

```yaml
// rest of file contents omitted...

"%test":
  quarkus:
    log:
      level: INFO
      category:
        "dev.chiedo":
          level: DEBUG
    hibernate-orm:
      log:
        sql: true
    flyway:
      migrate-at-start: true
      locations: db/migration,db/testdata
```

To run the test(s) use the following command:

```bash
$ quarkus test
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```bash
$ ./mvnw test
```

## Summary

This tutorial was a high-level introduction to the Quarkus framework. We've successfully built a simple REST API and learnt some important API development concepts along the way.
