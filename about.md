My background is in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I specifically majored in Computer Engineering, which was offered as a sub-discipline in the EE department.

I have spent a good chunk of my professional life working in the technical training space: as a software development trainer, electrical engineering instructor, a technical curriculum developer, and a technical content developer. I have also served as a Head of Department (ICT and Engineering) in a technical training college.

A couple of years ago I decided to transition into the software engineering space. **I am mainly interested in distributed/backend systems and programming languages/compilers**. So far, I've mostly worked with **Python**, **Java**, and **Rust**.

In one of my previous roles as a developer, I worked for an insurance brokerage firm as a consultant software engineer (short-term contract). I was part of a team that worked on an **insurance claims application** (I specifically worked on the cards management service). The app was based on a **microservices architecture**, with about 25 different services. Some of the technologies that we used are: **Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, RabbitMQ, Liquibase, Camunda (business workflow automation), ArgoCD, Azure DevOps, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.

I've also worked at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) as a Technical Content Developer. I was employee number 1 on the Nairobi [Identity platform documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/) team. I consequently became the "unofficial" Nairobi team lead. In this capacity, I developed the onboarding manual that was used to onboard new team members (the team had grown to 8 members when I left). I also offered mentorship to junior team members.

And before joining Microsoft, I worked at [Andela](https://www.andela.com/) as a software development technical trainer (as a member of the Bootcamp training team).

Prior to shifting into the industry, I worked in academia, as an engineering instructor at [Zetech University](https://zetech.ac.ke/) and a [technical training college](https://www.kips.ac.ke/).

I am an **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**. I have also authored a [high-level guide](https://chrischiedo.github.io/rust-for-java-devs/) for Java developers who are interested in learning Rust.

I am currently working as  a freelance software engineer and an open-source contributor (here's an [example of a contribution](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/41862) that I made to the [Quarkus project](https://github.com/quarkusio) that I'm especially proud of).

I'm naturally a **very curious person**, and I particularly enjoy learning new things every day. **I feel energized when working with small, highly motivated teams that care deeply about delivering business results**.
